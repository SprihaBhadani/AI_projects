Cats vs Dogs Classification using CNN

Overview
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The goal is to accurately predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog by leveraging deep learning techniques.

train/: Contains the training images.
validation/: Contains the validation images.
test/: Contains the test images for evaluating the model.
You can download the dataset from Kaggle here and place it in the data/ directory.

Usage
Data Preprocessing: This includes resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images to improve model generalization.

Model Building:  The architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

Training:  The model will be trained on the training set, validated on the validation set, and the best model will be saved based on validation accuracy.

Inference: Simply place your images in a specified directory and run the script to see if the model classifies them as a cat or a dog.

Results and Visualizations
The results/ directory contains logs, model weights, and visualizations.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification tasks. The model developed can effectively distinguish between images of cats and dogs, showcasing the power of deep learning in computer vision.

Future Work
Experiment with more complex architectures like ResNet or VGG16.
Implement transfer learning to improve performance.
Deploy the model as a web application for real-time image classification.
